<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>To Upload Claims Information</strong></span><br/>
<ul>
<li>Located in the top right section of the Claim screen, Click ‘Import’.    File can be in EXCEL or PDF format as noted in the left or right section of the pop up screen.  You may upload by clicking on the side applicable to your file format that you choose from a file on your computer or you may drag and drop the file to the appropriate side of the pop up.</li>
</ul>
<p>TIP:  You may view the claims table information in an excel format or create your own claims template from this section.   This is useful for when a carrier sends you claims information that may be separate from a loss run report that you would like to keep track of for your client.  The excel file can be edited or reused for any account which can later be uploaded to the claims section for use within the app.  To do this, click on 'Export' located on the upper right had side of the claims screen.  An excel file will be generated for you to save to your computer.   </p>
