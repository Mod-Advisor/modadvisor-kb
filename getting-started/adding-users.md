# Adding Users

<p>This can only be done by a User with an Admin account.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the plus sign in the top right corner of the page.</li>
<li>Add in their information: first name, last name, email, phone number and set a password for them.</li>
<li>You can then decide if you want them to be a User, Producer or Admin.</li>
<li>Select “Create” and they will receive an email welcoming them to Mod Advisor.</li>
</ul>
<p>If needed, you are always able to go back and change their information, reset password or resend invitation email.</p>
