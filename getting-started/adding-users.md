# Adding Users

This can only be done by a User with an Admin account.

* Navigate to the plus sign in the top right corner of the page.
* Add in their information: first name, last name, email, phone number and set a password for them.
* You can then decide if you want them to be a User, Producer or Admin.
* Select “Create” and they will receive an email welcoming them to Mod Advisor.

If needed, you are always able to go back and change their information, reset password or resend invitation email.
