# What are the different User types?

<p><strong>Types of Users:</strong> User Type determines the access and permissions a User has in Mod Advisor. There are three user types with their own permissions available in your organization.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User </strong>- Users can log into Mod Advisor and access all accounts and mod files within your organization. They can create and manage accounts, update mod files, and run or share reports.</li>
<li><strong>Producers</strong> - Producers do not have a login to Mod Advisor. They can be assigned to reports so their names and details appear on them.</li>
<li><strong>Admin </strong>- Admins have all the permissions of a User, with the added ability to manage Agency Information and other users. Be cautious when assigning Admin access. Itâ€™s best to limit this role to one person in your organization.</li>
</ul>
