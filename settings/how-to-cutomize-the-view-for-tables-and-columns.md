# How To Cutomize The View For Tables And Columns

There are two places to customize columns:

* **Profile Settings** - Changes here apply to all mod files you view unless a specific mod claim has its own settings. These changes won’t affect other users.
* **Claims Screen** - Customizing columns for a specific mod applies to all users for that claim. These settings override any profile customizations.

### **1.    Customizing Columns: From Profile Settings**

* Click your **Username** in the top right corner.&#x20;
* Select **Profile**.&#x20;
*   Look for **Claims Columns Settings** section and click **Columns.  Choose the options you want to see for your default and advanced views explained below.** \
    \
    **Default View:** Columns turned **On** in the Default View will display for every claim. These make up your standard view of claim information.\
    \
    &#x20;**Advanced View**: When detail is needed, the options you turn “On” will be visible when you turn on the Advanced view while on Claims screen. This view will show all columns **turned on** for Advanced View, along with the columns already visible in the Default View.\
    \


    _**NOTE**_:   If one view is **On**, the other will be **Off**.  Turning both views **Off** will make the column invisible when you view a claim unless the claim has custom settings.&#x20;
* Once you have made your default and advanced view selections, click "Save" at the bottom of the pop up to save your changes.

2\.     **Customizing Columns: from Claims Screen**

Later, while in a mod file on Claims screen, you can add/remove columns by clicking the “Columns” button on the upper right just above the table.

**REMEMBER: Customizing these columns while in a specific mod applies to all users for that claim. These settings override any profile customizations.**
